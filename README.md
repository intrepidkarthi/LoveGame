Love helps you to find whether your partner is ready to become your soulmate based on the psychological research. The app has a set of 36 questions framed in an ordered manner. Take your partner to a quiet place preferably a candle light dinner and take the love test. You don't need to enter any data in the app. Just read out the question, take your time, answer the question to your partner and let your partner answer for the same. This is a perfect app for your valentine's day!

The test will take may be an hour or more than that. There is no time constraint. Take your own time and find the best in you and your partner. Once you are done with the test, please share it across through SMS, whatsapp, facebook, twitter, instagram and LinkedIn. All the best!
This app is based on the research by Arthur Aron on The experimental generation of inter personal closeness: A procedure and some preliminary findings. Here is the link to the research paper: http://psp.sagepub.com/content/23/4/363.full.pdf
